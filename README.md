# game-htmlcanvas-practice
A simple HTML5 game I created to practice with canvas and javascript.

The goal of the game is to capture as many monsters as possible. Every time you capture a monster, it will come back as a dead monster on the game board. If you run into a dead monster, you will die and the game will end and start over, so don't do that.

Game was created by taking the following tutorial as a starting point and then changing the game from there.  http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/

Credit also due to the following implementation by baconsaur, which provided some great ideas on how to handle some of the gameplay!
